## Your first VM
I'm running Windows 11. While creating the VM, I encountered quite a few difficulties. I began by mistakenly not entering the "git clone" command, and  that kept causing an error message. After getting help, and fixing that, I somehow managed to push the file to a completely different location. Was able to get that corrected as well.
